# ToDoList
Time is the most precious thing that human being can come across with , helping others to manage their day with code is super so I put a ToDoList web app in this repo. Feel free to use itüòç

To use this ToDoList web app, scroll down to "Add a to-do" and click on the text box then write whatever you planned to do, then click enter. 

you can also specify time manually, for instance "Gym || 4:00-5:30" .

if you completed a specific task click on the radio button , it will automatically strikethrough the task.
if you want to delete a specific task go to the right side of your task and click the trash button, then the task will be deleted.

the task will not be lost even if you refresh the page ,
the date by default is set to current date.
