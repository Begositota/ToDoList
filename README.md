# ToDoList
Time is the most precious thing that human being can come across with , helping others to manage their day with code is super so I put a ToDoList web app in this repo. Feel free to use itüòç

To use this ToDoList web app, scroll down to "Add a to-do" and click on the text box then write whatever you planned to do, then click enter. 

you can also specify time manually, for instance "Gym || 4:00-5:30" .

When you completed a specific task click on the radio button , it will automatically strikethrough the task.
when you want to delete a specific task click on the right side of your task then click the trash button.

the task will not be lost even if you refresh the page ,
the date by default is set to current date.
